So, you wonder why there were so many commits?
Here's why:
I commited a lot of times without noticing I wasn't logged into the extension I use for commiting changes. That is all there is to it.

 I have been working on it quite a bit lately, and I hope this will be useful for somebody.
 But the reason I made this repo is to get a solid understanding of what developing open source is like, so yeah.
 There will be a lot more that will be changed and/or added in here from time to time, depends on what I do.

 Not yet capable of doing quality stuff, but trying my best.
 also, I am showing this repository to my teacher so fingers crossed on that.
 bye for now.

03/14/22, for now I have decided to delay adding things because of following reasons:
 I don't feel like working on it for a bit for now.
 I want to try out other stuff outside of this.
 And by the biggest factor, I deem it as finished, since it would be rinse and repeat the whole time.
