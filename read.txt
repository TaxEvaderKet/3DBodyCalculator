So, you wonder why there were so many commits?
Here's why:
I commited a lot of times without noticing I wasn't logged into the extension I use for commiting changes. That is all there is to it.

 I have been working on it quite a bit lately, and I hope this will be useful for somebody.
 But the reason I made this repo is to get a solid understanding of what developing open source is like, so yeah.
 There will be a lot more that will be changed and/or added in here from time to time, depends on what I do.
