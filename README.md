## Updates
### Updates will happen quite frequently
#### Around 7pm UK time there will be at least one commit.
It is usually the case, but on the weekend I will be doing at least 3 commits.
>It won't stop until I have reworked most of it so it is good and readable.
>And also until I figure out how the `jar` command works.
